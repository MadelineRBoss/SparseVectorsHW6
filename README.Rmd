The goal of SpraseVectorsHW6 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of SpraseVectorsHW6 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MadelineRBoss/SparseVectorsHW6")
```

## Example

Creating a Sparse Vector

```{r example}
library(SpraseVectorsHW6)

x <- new("sparse_numeric",
                 value = c(1, 2, 3, 1),
                 pos = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 5L),
                 length = 10L)
y <- new("sparse_numeric",
                 value = c(4, 6, 1, 2),
                 pos = c(1L, 3L, 5L, 7L),
                 length = 10L)
```

Plot two vectors to see where they overlap
```{r}
plot(x, y)
```

Add, Multiply, Subtract, and Cross Product Vectors
```{r}
sparse_add(x,y)
x + y
```
```{r}
sparse_mult(x,y)
x * y
```
```{r}
print(sparse_sub(x,y))
x - y
```
```{r}
print(sparse_crossprod(x,y))
```

Get the sum, mean, norm, and standardize vector
```{r}
sparse_sum(x)
```

```{r}
mean(x)
```

```{r}
norm(x)
```

```{r}
standardize(x)
```
